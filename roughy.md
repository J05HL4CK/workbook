    Packets are small chunks of information reasonably sized for ease of transmission over the physical network. Each packet is responsible for carrying data of variable length.

Packets are used to break large pieces of data down into smaller separable blocks so it can be transmitted over different routes. Following on from this, packets are an integral part of being able to transmit data without having to prearrange a connection to the device intended to communicate with.
